        <div id="rest">
            <section class="main-content">
                <div id="text-body">
                    <p>"Well... I'm so and so,<br />
                    I was given this name by my parents,<br />
                    I've been to such and such a college,<br />
                    I've done these things in my profession,<br />
                    and I produce a little biography."</p>

                    <p>Buddha says forget it, that isn't you.<br />
                    That's just some story.<br />
                    That's all gone, that's all passed.<br />
                    I want to see the real you!<br />
                    Who you are now!<br />
                    Well nobody knows who that is.<br />
                    Because we don't know ourselves except through listening to our echoes, and consulting our memories.</p>

                    <p>But then there's a real you, and that again leads us back to this question:<br />
                    <br /><span class="strong">Who are you?</span><br /><br />
                    We shall see how they play with this exam,<br />
                    if they will emerge from a faceted shell,<br />
                    and find out who they really are.</p>

                    <p>You will find that the Zen people are quite divided on this.<br />
                    They will say, "No we don't believe literally in reincarnation.<br />
                    That after your funeral, you will suddenly become somebody different, living somewhere else."<br />
                    They will say, "Reincarnation means this:<br />
                    that if you sitting here now, are you really convinced that you're the same person who walked in at the door half an hour ago, you are being reincarnated.<br />
                    If you're liberated, you'll understand that you're not.<br />
                    The past doesn't exist.<br />
                    The future doesn't exist.<br />
                    There is only the present and that is the only real you that there is."</p>

                    <p>The Zen master Dogen put it this way, he said<br />
                    "The Spring does not become the summer; first there is spring, and then there is summer."</p>

                    <p>T.S. Elliot has the same idea in his poem "The Four Quartets"<br />
                    â€”<br />
                    where he says: "When you settle down in the train to read your newspaper...<br />
                    you are not the same person who left the platform."</p>

                    <p>If you think you are, you are linking your moments up in a chain,<br />
                    and this is what binds you to the <span class="off">wheel of birth and death.</span></p>

                    <p>When you know that every moment in which you are, is the only moment, this comes into Zen:<br />
                    A master will say to somebody: "but get up and walk across the room!"<br />
                    and he comes back and the master says "Where are your footprints?"<br /><br />
                    They've gone<br />.<br />
                    So where are you?<br />.<br />
                    Who are you?<br />.<br />.<br />
                    When we are asked who we are, we usually give a kind of recitation of a history:<br />
                    .<br />
                    .<br />
                    .<br />
                    <br />
                    <span id="out-text" class="off" class="strong">You are not a receding chain of events</span></p>
